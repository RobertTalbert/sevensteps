# Seven Steps to Flipped Learning Design

This is a repo for source material for my workbook _Seven Steps to Flipped Learning Design_ used in my flipped learning design workshops.

A significantly expanded version of this is contained in my book _Flipped Learning: A Guide for Higher Education Faculty_ (Stylus Publications 2017). Available at [Stylus' website](https://sty.presswarehouse.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=468277) or on [Amazon](http://a.co/hrqEnMy). Just look for the turtle.

Direct all questions about this workbook to me at [talbertr@gvsu.edu](mailto:talbertr@gvsu.edu).
