# Seven Steps to Flipped Learning Design

This is a repo for source material for my workbook _Seven Steps to Flipped Learning Design_ used in my flipped learning design workshops.

A significantly expanded version of this is contained in my book _Flipped Learning: A Guide for Higher Education Faculty_ to be published by Stylus Publishing in May 2017. Just look for the turtle.

Direct all questions about this workbook to me at [talbertr@gvsu.edu](mailto:talbertr@gvsu.edu).
